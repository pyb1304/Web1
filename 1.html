  When Allie and Noah return to her parents' mansion, it is revealed that due to
  their difference in social class, Allie's parents, particularly her mother Anne, do not approve
  of the relationship and forbid her from seeing him. Overhearing Allie's mother's insults, which include
  going as far as to call him trash, Noah walks out and Allie chases after him. After revealing to Allie that he d
  oes not think their relationship will work, an argument ensues, leading Allie to break up with Noah in the heat of the moment
   as he leaves, though she quickly regrets it. The next morning, Anne announces that the family is returning home to Charleston that sa
   me day. Allie attempts to find Noah at the lumber mill, but he is out delivering a load, so she asks Fin to tell Noah that she loves him. When Noa
   h receives the message, he rushes to Allie's home, only to find the house gated up and empty.</P>
